### Tips

- Test things under different environments, browsers.
- Make a flow diagram of deciding to opt-in or out of features.
- Test every input, but know when to give up.
- When one directory isn't accessible, try its subdirectories.
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari encode `location.search` and `location.hash`.
- IE11 and Edge (pre-Chromium) don't encode sources.

### Vulnerability Classes
#### SQLi

- [Portswigger - SQL injection cheatsheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet) (doesn't include sqlite)
- Do a simple sanity check for `'` or `"` in payload. Try bypassing client side restrictions for input in fields such as date.
- Oracle comments don't work with semicolon. `OR 1=1--` might work when `OR 1=1;--` doesn't.
- MySQL comments `--` require a space after them to work `-- `.
- Remember to encode spaces to `+` and other url unsafe characters as well.
- When using `UNION` to extract `table\_name`, make sure that it is positioned with a column that has the same datatype.
- In where clause, try to use quotes to cover table and column names.
- While `union` can be used with `select`, look for **stacked queries** to execute any SQL statement. Remember to commit.
- If any words are filtered, see if they are done recursively. If not, `selselectect` if will work.

- [Portswigger - Blind SQL injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/blind)

#### PHP issues

- Type confusion: If an array is passed to `strcmp()`, it will give a warning but the compare result returns 0.
- Object injection: If `unserialize()` is being used, you might be able to craft an object and use trampoline functions.
- Type juggling: `0e123` evaluates to `0`.

#### XSS

- [Portswigger - XSS cheatsheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet)
- [Portswigger - XSS contexts](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts)
- When browsers parse tag attributes, they HTML-decode their values first. `<foo bar='z'>` is the same as `<foo bar='&#x7a;'>`
- AngularJS `ng-app` attribute is processed by AngularJS. Anything within `{{}}` will be executed.
- jQuery `attr()` used to change attributes, can act as a sink.

#### XXE

- [PayloadAllTheThings - XXE](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/XXE%20Injection)
    - Retrieve files
    - SSRF through XXE

#### SSTI
#### SSRF
#### CSRF
