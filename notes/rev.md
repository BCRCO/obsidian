### Initial checks
- ```file <binary>```
- ```strings <binary>```
- ```./<binary>```

### Assembly Language
- Running a program ```nasm -felf64 hello.asm && ld hello.o && ./a.out```
- Byte (8 bits), word (16 bits) and double word (32 bits)
- RAX: 64-bit, EAX: 32-bit value, AX is the lower 16-bits, AL is the lower 8 bits, AH is the bits 8 through 15 (zero-based)
- What does ```call``` do?
  1. Pushes address of next instruction on to the stack
  2. Changes ```eip``` to given address
- Passing arguments
  - _64 bit_ : first four arguments rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx
  - _32 bit_ : push arguments on to the stack (include them in the payload)
  - Arguments are placed on the stack as follows:

```
asm0(0xd8,0x7a)

# args are pushed while in the previous stack frame
# ebp + x means we are moving upwards, i.e., opposite
# to the direction of growth of the stack

ebp + 0x8 = 0x7a
ebp + 0xc = 0xd8
```

### GDB
- <https://darkdust.net/files/GDB%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf>
- Address of a variable ```p &var```
- Changing variable values ```set var <variable_name>=<value>```
- Disable SIGALRM ``` handle SIGALRM ignore ```
- Learn about fuzzing
