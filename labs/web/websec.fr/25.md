Challenge code

```
<?

parse_str(parse_url($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'])['query'], $query);

foreach ($query as $k => $v)
    if (stripos($v, 'flag') !== false)
        die('You are not allowed to get the flag, sorry :/');

include $_GET['page'] . '.txt';

?>
```

- php wrappers won't work since we are required to put "flag" in the value for the parameter.
- Tried [this](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/17407/how-can-i-use-this-path-bypass-exploit-local-file-inclusion) attack but got `414 Request-URI Too Large`.
