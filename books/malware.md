### Techniques

- Antivirus Scanning: http://www.virustotal.com/
- Hashing: see if the file has already been identified
- Strings: get hints about functionality

### Packed and obfuscated malware

- Obfuscated programs are ones whose execution the malware author has attempted to hide.
- Packed programs are a subset of obfuscated programs in which the malicious program is compressed and cannot be analyzed.

**NOTE** Packed and obfuscated code will often include LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress
